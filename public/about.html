<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Muhammed Jaezzath, a highly motivated and detail-oriented web developer with a strong foundation in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p> I recently completed a coding bootcamp where I gained practical experience in React.js and Node.js through hands-on projects.</p>

<p>I'm eager to apply my skills and contribute to a dynamic team where I can learn and grow as a web developer.</p>
